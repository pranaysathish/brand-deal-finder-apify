# Startup Sponsorship Finder 🎯

**The smartest way to find brand sponsorships for content creators.**

## 🚀 What Makes This Actor DIFFERENT?

Most sponsorship tools just check pre-defined URL lists. **This Actor is intelligent.**

### ❌ What Other Tools Do:
```
Tool: "Let me check these 20 URLs I memorized"
→ Half return 404 errors
→ Outdated information
→ Same brands everyone knows
```

### ✅ What This Actor Does:
```
1. Google Search: Discovers brands actively sponsoring creators
2. Visit Homepage: Intelligently crawls each brand's website  
3. Auto-Find: Locates actual partnership pages (not guessing URLs)
4. Extract Data: Gets real contact info, requirements, rates
5. Highlight New: Marks emerging brands (2024/2025 launches)
```

**Result:** Fresh, accurate, verified sponsorship opportunities you won't find anywhere else.
